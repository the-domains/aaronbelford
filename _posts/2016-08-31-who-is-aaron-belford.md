## Who is Aaron Belford?

Aaron Belford (°1978, Edina, United States) is an artist who mainly works with photography. By questioning the concept of movement, Belford finds that movement reveals an inherent awkwardness, a humour that echoes our own vulnerabilities. The artist also considers movement as a metaphor for the ever-seeking man who experiences a continuous loss.

His photos isolate the movements of humans and/or objects. By doing so, new sequences are created which reveal an inseparable relationship between motion and sound. By examining the ambiguity and origination via retakes and variations, he plays with the idea of the mortality of an artwork confronted with the power of a transitory appearance, which is, by being restricted in time, much more intense.

His works are made through strict rules which can be perceived as liberating constraints. Romantic values such as 'inspiration', 'genius' and 'authenticity' are thereby neutralised and put into perspective. By applying a wide variety of contemporary strategies, he tries to increase the dynamic between audience and author by objectifying emotions and investigating the duality that develops through different interpretations.

His works never shows the complete structure. This results in the fact that the artist can easily imagine an own interpretation without being hindered by the historical reality. Aaron Belford currently lives and works in Minneapolis.
